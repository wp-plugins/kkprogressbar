Plugin shows/indicates progress that has been made on projects or articles.
KKProgressbar 2 is a totally new uncover of my plugin. This plugin allows you to show the progress made on your projects. The new version (2.x) segregates projects and tasks so that you can see which tasks need to be completed to finish a project. In premium version the number of projects and tasks that can be added is unlimited. Users of the old plugin (1.1.x Free and 1.3.x Premium) do not need to be worried as I took care of them as well. New plugin will detect his older friend and convert the data to the new version under the condition that user allows for it. 

Options in that version are fairly limited as compared to professional version, however, plugin has the same possibilities as version 1.1.3 with some new updates.

Please find below all the options that you can get by purchasing professional version:

+ Unlimited number of projects that can be added

+ Much more advanced option of adjusting the display of progressbar to your personal needs

+ Free-of-charge support

+ Free and frequent updates providing new options to the plugin.

If you are willing to support my work or you are looking for more options, feel free to purchase professional version of the plugin.
